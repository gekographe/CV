Web Development
---------------

I always wanted to learn about web development but I hate 
to do things only half way, if I start something I go all 
the way. I wrote my first of code 5 months ago, since then
I attended Makers Academy for three months and, among a
lot of things, I learnt to learn fast and be efficient.
