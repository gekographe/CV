As a passionate developer,
So that I can help a company to reach for the stars,
I would like them to know that I'm looking for new challenges.

Code Example

Web Development
---------------

I wrote my first line of code 5 months ago. I always wanted to learn about web development, but if I start something I go all 
the way - so I attended Makers Academy for three months and, among many things, I figured out how to learn fast and be efficient with my time.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner
```
As a developer,
So that I can be quick and efficient,
I want to prove to my new employer that I can pick up new skills quickly.
```

- 3 months ago I started to study at Makers Academy. 
  Today I know and use on a daily basis Ruby, JavaScript, 
  use various frameworks to TDD my apps, and use ORMs to work with SQL databases,
  know and apply conventions like SOLID and REST.
- Personal projects gave me the occasion to learn in a week how to
  hack a game and learn about hexadecimal code. I also started to write code using Assembly.

#### Test-Driven Development
```
As a developer,
So that I can ship a great app,
I want to write great tests to make sure everything runs smoothly
```

- A great app is a tested app, working without testing might
  seem like a time-saving way of coding but in the long-term
  it's counterproductive.
- I'm trained to use RSpec, Jasmine and Cucumber
- I created my own JavaScript testing framework 

#### Teamwork & Communication
```
As a developer,
So that I can deliver world-class software,
I would love to work in a team-driven environment.
```

- Communicating is one of the most important part of teamwork
  and it's important to keep this link intact by sharing knowledge
  through stand-ups, retrospectives and good use of feedback.
- I'm well-versed in pair-programming and enjoy it very much.
- Diagramming is a great way to explain your understanding of a system and I find it useful to explain my train of thoughts.

## Experience
```
As a developer,
So that I can provide a keen, fresh eye
I want my new team to know that I come from a different background
```

#### Makers Academy

- Makers Academy is a bootcamp but most importantly it's an experience 
  that taught me what working in a challenging environment is like.
  Every week we had new challenges to face, and finding solutions to each
  of them was an amazing experience.
  
#### Photography

- Before starting my new exciting life as a junior developper
  I used to work in photography as a photographer's assistant. 
  Photography is a creative but also a very competitive world 
  with tight deadlines- I know what working under pressure means.
- I got the chance to work with great photographers like 
  Paolo Roversi (Fashion photography) or Stanley Greene (War photography)
  and understand what working at the highest levels requires.
  
#### Apple Store

- I used to work in an Apple Store as a Specialist. It was a great experience
  where I learnt for the first time the concept of positive feedback, and got the opportunity
  to work in a big team and exchange with lots of people.
  
#### Bartender

- I also worked as a bartender in different places. I had to operate in
  a very fast environment where your team is _everything_. It also meant I had to quickly learn a lot of different aspect of bartending like: 
  - cocktail recipes
  - be self-aware of my surroundings
  - become a good listener
  - also I pour a great beer, just to say

## Education

#### Makers Academy 

- Studied web development, and learnt how to learn quickly and effectively.

#### Gobelins, l'ecole de l'image - Paris

- Studied photography for 3 years, learning about lights, the technicals aspects of a shooting and I have great photoshop skills.

#### University of La Sorbonne - Paris

- Studied geography and geology for a year.

#### LISAA - Paris

- Studied art history for a year.

## A bit more

- I started a photography project using a [Gameboy Camera](https://www.instagram.com/gameboycameraman/). Instagram [shared](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKofrdFD4IF/) I'm currently exhibiting a series of these pictures in [The Hague Photography Museum](http://www.fotomuseumdenhaag.nl/en/exhibitions/gameboycameraman), in the Netherlands.

- I craft my own boardgames. It's a great way to learn how to solve problems and understand how to bring a project from scratch to a full-release version.
