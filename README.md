```
As a passionate junior developer,
So that I can help a company to reach for the stars,
I would like them to know that I'm looking for new challenges.

Code Example
------------

| [Invading the Invaders](https://github.com/gekographe/invading_invaders) |
|:--------------- |
| Documentation created after learning how to hack a video game. Hacking and documentation made in 5 days with [Vivien Tang](https://github.com/honjintang), [Hasan Sonmez](https://github.com/UltimateCoder00) and [William Schwier](https://github.com/w-schwier).|

Web Development
---------------

I always wanted to learn about web development but I hate 
to do things only half way, if I start something I go all 
the way. I wrote my first of code 5 months ago, since then
I attended Makers Academy for three months and, among a
lot of things, I learnt to learn fast and be efficient.

## Skills

#### Fast Leaner
```
As a developer,
So that I can be quickly efficient,
I want to prove to my new employer that I can to learn new skills quickly.
```

- 3 months ago I started to study at Makers Academy. 
  Today I know and use on a daily base Ruby, JavaScript, 
  use TDD to develop and test my apps, SQL and work with databases,
  know and apply conventions like SOLID or REST.
- Personnal projects gave me the occasion to learn in a week how to
  hack a game and learn about hexadecimal code, I also learnt and
  starded to write code using Assembly.

#### Test Driven Development
```
As a developer,
So that I can deliver a great app,
I would write great tests to make sure everything runs smoothly
```

- A great app is a tested app, working without testing might
  seem like a time saving way of coding but on the long term
  it's counterproductive.
- I'm trained to use rspec, jasmine or cucumber
- I created my own Javascript testing framework 

#### Teamwork & Communication
```
As a developer,
So that I can deliver improved bits of codes,
I would love to work in a teamplay driven environment.
```

- Communicating is one of the most important part of a team
  and it's important to keep this link intact by sharing 
  through stand-up, retrospective and a good use of feedbacks.
- I'm well versed in pair coding and enjoy it very much.
- Diagramming is a great way to share your thoughts and I like
  to do it for myself or explain my chain of thoughts.

## Experience
```
As a developer,
So that I can bring a keene fresh eye
I want my new team to know that I come from a different background
```

#### Makers Academy

- Makers Academy is a school but most importantly it's an experience 
  that taught me what working in a challenging environment would be.
  Every week we had new challenges to face and finding solutions to each
  of them was an amazing experience.
  
#### Photography

- Before starting my new exciting life as a junior developper
  I used to work in photography as a photographer assistant. 
  Photography is a creative but also a very competitive world 
  with important deadlines, I know what working under pressure means.
- I got the chance to work with different great photographers like 
  Paolo Roversi (Fashion photography) or Stanley Greene (War photography)
  and know what high work quality imply.
  
#### Apple Store

- I used to work in an Apple Store as a Specialist. It was a great experience
  where I learnt for the first the concept of positive feedback and got the opportunity
  to work in a big team and exchange with lots of people.
  
#### Bartender

- I also worked as a bartender in differents place. Made me work in
  a very fast environment where your team is everything. It also asked
  me to learn fast a lot of different aspect of bartending like 
  cocktails recipee, be self-aware of my surrounding and a good listener.
  Also I pour a great beer, just to say.

## Education

#### Makers Academy

- I craft my own boardgames. 
  It's a great way to learn how to solve problems and understand how to bring a project from a beta version to a full release   version.

- I run an instagram account using a [Gameboy Camera](https://www.instagram.com/gameboycameraman/).
