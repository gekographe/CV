As a passionate junior developer,
So that I can help a company to reach for the stars,
I would like them to know that I'm looking for new challenges.

Code Example
------------

| [Invading the Invaders](https://github.com/gekographe/invading_invaders) |
|:--------------- |
| Documentation created after learning how to hack a video game. Hacking and documentation made in 5 days with [Vivien Tang](https://github.com/honjintang), [Hasan Sonmez](https://github.com/UltimateCoder00) and [William Schwier](https://github.com/w-schwier).|

Web Development
---------------

I always wanted to learn about web development but I hate 
to do things only half way, if I start something I go all 
the way. I wrote my first of code 5 months ago, since then
I attended Makers Academy for three months and, among a
lot of things, I learnt to learn fast and be efficient.

## Skills

#### Fast Leaner
```
As a developer,
So that I can be quickly efficient,
I want to prove to my new employer that I can to learn new skills quickly.
```

- 

#### Test Driven Development
```
As a developer,
So that I can deliver a great app,
I would write great tests to make sure everything runs smoothly
```

- A great app is a tested app, working without testing might
  seem like a time saving way of coding but on the long term
  it's counterproductive.
- I'm trained to use rspec, jasmine or cucumber
- I created my own Javascript testing framework 

#### Teamwork & Communication
```
As a developer,
So that I can deliver improved bits of codes,
I would love to work in a teamplay driven environment.
```

- Communicating is one of the most important part of a team
  and it's important to keep this link intact by sharing 
  through stand-up, retrospective and a good use of feedbacks.
- I'm well versed in pair coding and enjoy it very much.
- Diagramming is a great way to share your thoughts and I like
  to do it for myself or explain my chain of thoughts.

## Education
